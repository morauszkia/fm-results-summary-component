## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Vite](https://vite.dev) - Build Tool

### What I learned

It was a while since I last worked with Vue.js, and it was great to revisit this framework. I like Vue.js' 1 file / component approach to building components by colocating template, styles and logic in a single file, while separating concerns within the file.

### Continued development

In the future I want to use Vue.js more often to build more complex applications. I would also like to become more familiar with static asset handling in Vite+Vue applications.

I am also giving Svelte a try by [building the same components](https://github.com/morauszkia/fm-results-summary-svelte). Check out the linked repo, if you're curious.

### Useful resources

- [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
- [Vite docs](https://vite.dev/guide/assets.html) - These helped me a lot, especially with static asset handling and deployment.
